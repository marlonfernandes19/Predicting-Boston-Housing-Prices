## Predicting Boston Housing Prices


The objective/goal of the project is to obtain an optimal model based on a statistical data to estimate the best price for a customer to buy a house in Boston, Massachusetts. 

### Dataset 
The dataset used for this project is included in scikit-learn library (sklearn.datasets.load_boston) which the data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. The expense of a house varies according to various factors like average number of rooms per dwelling, full-value property-tax rate per $10,000,  pupil-teacher ratio, crime rate, etc.

### Algorithm : 
#### Linear regression algorithm
Linear regression algorithm is one of the fundamental supervised machine-learning algorithms due to its relative simplicity and well-known properties.Regression is a method of modelling a target value based on independent predictors. It is mostly used for forecasting and finding out cause and effect relationship between variables.

Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable.
